personal-cloud
==============

Extensible PHP + SQLite server software for interfacing with home automation equipment, media players, and more.

This code should be installed into a server solution such as Apache (or Slawdog Personal Cloud), which should run on the system you will be controlling your media, automation, etc. from. You may also wish to add port forwarding in order to connect to Personal Cloud remotely.

The software exists in order to supplement Slawdog Remote, an Android app that allows a customized push-button interface, file browsing, and voice-activated automation. More importantly, it is the software running on Slawdog Personal Cloud, an Apache-based Windows solution to running this code.

Future ideas:
- Improved front end with admin system
- Improved desktop experience
- Built-in HTML5-based media player and scanner
- Linux and MacOS support for file browser

How you can contribute:
- Add Linux and MacOS support for file browser
- Add some home automation modules (Vera would be a good start)
